            text: 'In the early Universe, hydrogen and helium were the dominant elements. The first stars formed from these components and underwent nuclear reactions, leading to the formation of heavier elements. These massive Population III stars quickly exhausted their fuel and culminated in explosive supernova events, which contributed heavy elements to the interstellar medium, enriching it significantly.'

        text: 'are classified into three categories: Population I, II, and III. Our Sun belongs to the Population I group, characterized by a substantial presence of heavy elements in its composition. Population II stars, on the other hand, possess fewer heavy elements and maintain a more pristine nature. Meanwhile, Population III stars exist only as theoretical entities and lack any metal content.'

        text: 'The subsequent generation of stars, referred to as Population II stars, emerged from this enriched material. Despite this enrichment, they still retained relatively lower quantities of heavy elements. Even today, some of these metal-poor stars can be observed within our own galaxy, the Milky Way.'

        text: 'The formation of stars and the enrichment of the interstellar medium rely on multiple factors, including the rate of star formation, history of mergers, and the sizes of star-forming regions. In galaxies of considerable proportions like ours, the atoms and molecules involved in star formation likely have been part of prior stellar generations.'
